# MAX-001: Standard Standard
## Summary
This standard represents the standard by which all standards (including this one) shall be governed. In terms of structure, standards within this folder must adhere to certain schema (e.g. markdown etc.) Standards should be clearly opinionated and therefore also challengeable.  
## Standard
### Format
Standards shall have a uniform format with certain elements must be the same. Use this one as a reference until this section is more fully fleshed out

### Content
* Standard shall be clearly stated opinions and shall be self-contained.  
* Standards can link to pictures/diagrams etc.  Keep the references to either other standards, or ideally to content referenced in this same folder so that it can be kept under control
* Limit references to outside sources as they might change (e.g. a standard which says: "we should follow xyz pattern at hxxps://link-to-somwhere-else.com" is not great because it will change over time and thereby change the original intent of the standard. [Note however that a standard that says something like: "we will adhere to PEP-008" with a link to Guido's manifesto, is probably ok in 2024]
* Standards should be targetted to a single purpose.
* Standards should not conflict with other standards.
